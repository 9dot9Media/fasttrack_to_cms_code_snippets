================================
Code Snippets used in  FastTrack
================================

Welcome dear reader!

In this repository you will find the code snippets used in the 'FastTrack to Building Your own
Custom CMS Using Django'. In mose cases these files are not meant to be run directly. Some are
supposed to be run one line at a time in the Python interpreter or Django shell.

While it's always preferable to follow along any coding workshop by typing everything rather than
copy-pasting, printed code can sometime be unclear. You can refer to the same version of the code
in this repository.

There is a separate folder for each chapter, and within it a separate file for each section.

If you are have finished reading the booklet and want to try out the final project for yourself,
the final project code has its own
`repository <https://github.com/9dot9Media/fasttrack_to_cms_final_code>`_.
